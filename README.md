XbICalendar Framework
===========

This is a simple project to allow for the inclusion of the [libical library](XbICalendar) in iOS projects via a framework. The framework is compiled with bitcode enabled. 

The code is a modification of the [XbLCalendar project](https://github.com/libical/XbICalendar) where the application and test targets have been removed and replaced with a single framework target.

Contributions
=======

I created this project for use within my own applications, so will only likely work on bugs if and when they arise. If you wish to create a pull request feel free. Adding back the tests target would be great!
